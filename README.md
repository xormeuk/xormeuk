My name is Matt Brocklehurst, and I specialize in producing bespoke embedded firmware solutions for various platforms including ESP32, ARM, PIC, and Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040). With years of experience in the field, I have developed a deep understanding of microcontroller architectures and embedded systems design principles. I am based in Manchester, UK.

As a freelance embedded firmware developer, I have had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from developing firmware for IoT devices to optimizing code for real-time applications. I take pride in delivering high-quality solutions that meet the unique requirements of each project. My expertise lies in C and C++, which I utilize extensively to create efficient and reliable firmware solutions.

In addition to my expertise in embedded firmware development, I also offer electronic design services. Whether itâ€™s designing custom circuit boards or prototyping new hardware solutions, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through innovative design and engineering.
